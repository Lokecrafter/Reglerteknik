What is the cross-over frequency and how can it be found in a Bode
plot?

• What is the phase-margin and how can it be found in a Bode plot?
The phase at the crossover frequency is the phase margin. 
It tells you how close to instability the system is.

• What is the amplitude-margin and how can it be found in a Bode plot?
The amplitude margin is how much gain K you can give Gc before it becomes instable.
You can find the amplitude marigin in the Bode-plot by finding which frequency gives the phase = -180 degrees.
The amplitude marigin is now the negative of the amplitude at said frequency.

• How to derive the errors e0 and e1?
e0 = 1/(1+Go(0))
e1 = lim(s->0) 1/(s*Go(s))

• How is the cross-over frequency, bandwidth, and rise time related?
(cross-over) ωc​ ~ ωB (bandwidth) ∝ 1/Tr (1/Rise time)

• How is the overshoot, phase margin, amplitude margin and stability
related?
ϕm​ > 0 and Am > 0 -> Stable system. Increasíng ϕm​ and Am gives a more stable system.
Mp ∝ 1/ϕm

• Concerning a lead-lag controller:
– How does the design parameter β affect the phase margin?
A smaller β gives more phase contribution from the Lead-part.

– How does the design of the lag-part affect the design of the lead-
controller?
The lag part lowers the phase a little bit so the lead part needs to raise the phase more to achieve
the same phase margin.

– Which frequency should the lead-lag controller mainly be designed
for?
It should be designed for the desired cross-over frequency.

– How are τD and τI usually defined?
τD comes from the position of the zero-point for the lead part.
τI comes from where the pole of the lag part is placed.

– What effect does the parameter γ have and what is the effect of
setting γ to zero?
The larger γ is the bigger the gain and the smaller the stationary error gets.
γ = 0 gives a perfect integrator just as the one found in a PID controller.

• What more information is contained in a state space model than in a
transfer function?
A state space model conatins more information like differential equations about the physics of the system. A transfer function
is just a function that takes an input ang gives an output.

• What is the main difference between input-output feedback and state
feedback?
Input-output feedback only regards the output of the model and uses that to control the system.
State feedback regards all the state model signals to calculate the control signal u.

mation can be found in the sensitivity plot?
